ðŸ‘‹ hi there! My name is [Vinod Chauhan](www.linkedin.com/in/vinod-chauhan7) and this is the source material for Build a [React_hooks](https://github.com/vinodchauhan7/react-hooks-ticTacToe) !

This is an simple app for learning hook via TicTacToe game. You can learn something which is more than beginners in this app.

# If you were given instructions for a specific branch to use, then use this command
# git clone --single-branch --branch <branchname> https://github.com/vinodchauhan7/react-hooks-ticTacToe.git

# otherwise, this is fine:
git clone https://github.com/vinodchauhan7/react-hooks-ticTacToe.git

# then do this:
cd bookshelf
npm run setup --silent
This may take a few minutes. If you get any errors, please read through them and see if you can find out what the problem is. You may also want to look at Troubleshooting. If you can't work it out on your own then please file an issue and provide all the output from the commands you ran (even if it's a lot).

Running the app
To get the app up and running (and really see if it worked), run:

npm start
This should start up your browser. If you're familiar, this is a standard react-scripts application.
